== Spring Data mariadb R2DBC basics
(adapted from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/master/r2dbc/example)

This projects shows some sample usage of the work-in-progress mariadb R2DBC support for Spring Data.

=== Interesting bits to look at

- `InfrastructureConfiguration` - sets up a R2DBC `ConnectionFactory` based on the R2DBC Mariadb driver, a `DatabaseClient` and a `R2dbcRepositoryFactory` to eventually create a `CustomerRepository`.
- `CustomerRepository` - a standard Spring Data reactive CRUD repository exposing query methods using manually defined queries
- `CustomerRepositoryIntegrationTests` - to initialize the database with some setup SQL and the inserting and reading `Customer` instances.
- `TransactionalService` - uses declarative transaction to apply a transactional boundary to repository operations.
